        <p> We use project-based fun learning program designed to introduce young children
        to the world of electronics, microcontrollers, and programming. With the aim of developing their curiosity and creativity, we use hands-on approach to engage children in creating their own projects, thus enabling them to apply their knowledge in a practical way. Through the program, children are exposed to various electronics concepts and gain a basic understanding of programming languages. With the support of skilled mentors, children are guided through the program in a fun and engaging way, building their confidence in the subject matter and developing valuable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. We believe that project based learning is an exciting and innovative way to inspire and nurture young minds.
